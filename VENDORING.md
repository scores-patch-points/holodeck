## Vendored reading fixture (2026-10-02, delink from clovenbradshaw at runtime)

`fixtures/reading/f3affd2e11370118-causalTextPerceiver_reviseTextFold_refresh25.jsonl.index.json`
and its `.cursor` are vendored byte-identical from `ohs-custody` `ground-readings/`. The
reading view (`reading-worker.js`) now reads the pre-built `FoldReadingIndex@2` beside the
app instead of fetching `raw.githubusercontent.com/clovenbradshaw-ctrl/ohs-custody` at
runtime, so the view survives the migration's clovenbradshaw delink (FOLD-MIGRATION Step 4:
"vendor the fixture, or gate the view on absence"). Only the index and cursor are vendored;
the 7.7 MB `.jsonl.zst` is left upstream — the pre-built index is the path actually used,
and the `.zst` path is only the key the index sits beside. `localStorage hd:reading`
overrides the source with any absolute `.jsonl.zst` (or sibling `.index.json`) URL.

### Updated in this project
- Upstream added ground-readings/…refresh25.jsonl.zst and its .cursor (1 commit after 40cf318)
- Reading view now reads the .zst from ohs-custody (already wired); decode is refused unless byte count matches the zstd frame header, every line parses, and encounter count matches the cursor (8,358)

| Fold Explorer v7.dc.html — Ask the Fold (holodeck-ask.js, holodeck-reader.js) | clovenbradshaw-ctrl/the-fold: fold.js, holon.js (surf-and-fold wiring, ported); eoreader7: native/the-fold/reader-bundle.js (ported to fetch-loaded priors), native/organs/{source,measure,cite,grounding,web,speaker,hypergraph,fact-block,aposiopesis,cast,asserted,heard-surfaces,kind-standing}.js, native/adapters/text/{priors,spans,surfaces,pronouns,relations-language,relations-gfp,relations-positional,clause-spans,grain-typing,wordclass,morphology}.js, native/{memory,kernel}/*, native/priors/{pos,morphology}-eng.json (vendored unchanged) |
| Fold Explorer v7.dc.html — Read three ways (holodeck-perspectives.js) | eoreader7: native/kernel/{perspective,bayes-surprise}.js (vendored byte-identical; diffed against upstream on copy). Three readers, one per live_priors genre, each a Dirichlet holograph over what a sentence does to the picture (never words); scored read-only against the workspace; kept apart with perspective.js divergence(). native/adapters/text/priors.js closed classes reused. |
| Referent links (holodeck-links.js) — arrow-of-time gate | eoreader7: native/organs/regime.js (vendored byte-identical under vendor/eoreader7/native/organs/; its only import, native/kernel/cube.js `GRAINS`, was already vendored). The identity gate's arrow-of-time check rides Kelsen's validity-window precedence (step 1 of the fixed order), never a re-derived temporal rule |
| Omnilingual summary lens (holodeck-lang.js) — UniMorph priors | eoreader7: native/priors/declension-rus.json (vendored byte-identical under vendor/eoreader7/native/priors/; the English irregular tail morphology-eng.json and pos-eng.json were already vendored). Loaded as data, injected via `setPriors` — never a model |

| Fold Explorer v7.dc.html — Ask the Fold → Data notebook (holodeck-notebook.js) | scores-patch-points/khora: native/kernel/sha256.js, native/the-fold/surface/{bench,notebook,notebook-store,notebook-workspace}.mjs — **byte-identical**, copied by `node vendor-sync.mjs`, hashes and commit in `vendor/eoreader7/NOTEBOOK-VENDOR.json`; `node vendor-sync.mjs --check` fails on drift |

| fold · chat (vendor/fold-chat/) | **scores-patch-points/the-fold @ bd6e513** — the standalone chat surface (LibreChat-style UX: artifacts, memory, presets, Chat/Code modes), vendored **byte-identical** by `node vendor-chat.mjs`; hashes and commit in `vendor/fold-chat/CHAT-VENDOR.json`; `node vendor-chat.mjs --check` fails on drift. It routes every inference through the heimdall bridge, so vendoring the UI vendors no model and no key. The fold's own integrated chat is `index.html?work=chat` (holodeck-chat-lane.js); this vendored page is the standalone reference/deployment surface |
| Coding machine (opencode) — behind heimdall | **scores-patch-points/opencode-fold @ f33899a** — vendored **by reference** (`vendor/opencode-fold/VENDOR.json`), never byte-copied: a ~560MB white-label fork of `anomalyco/opencode` that carries its own upstream-tracking contract (opencode-fold `UPSTREAM.md` + `brand/manifest.json`). Heimdall dispatches coding to a local `opencode serve` via `src/opencode-lane.js` + the bridge's `POST /api/code`; opencode's own model calls point back at the bridge's `/v1`, so routing stays heimdall's |
