// fold-chat-gaps.js — what the app says, in its own voice, when a turn has no
// answer to show or no source to stand on. Pure: no DOM, no IO, no model.
//
// The model is the mouth, not the narrator of the fold's own work (Constitution
// II.9; III.3 the absent test: a gap is DRAWN, as a typed mark, never said as
// prose by the assistant). Four things the model used to improvise are app-
// authored here, from facts the app holds:
//
//   • WHAT WAS SEARCHED — `searchAttempts` / `unreachedGap` read the real search
//     trace (which engines answered or failed, why, which pages could not be
//     read). The model is no longer asked to "name what you tried"; it invented
//     queries it never ran ("using keywords like 'easy banana bread'").
//   • LIVE DATA — `liveAsk` spots asks whose answer is a live feed (weather, a
//     price, a score, today's news). With nothing read that grounds an answer,
//     the turn is a typed gap ("live data — nothing reachable"), never a guess.
//   • THE UNSOURCED POLICY — `UNSOURCED_ANSWERS`, one named constant, and
//     `unsourcedPlan`, which says what the turn does when search reaches nothing.
//   • A BLANK OR FAILED TURN — `emptyNotice` / `errorNotice`: a turn that wrote
//     nothing or died is always drawn as an honest typed note with a retry.

// ── THE RULE: THE MODEL NEVER SPEAKS ALONE ────────────────────────────────
// A turn with no sources produces NO model-written answer. It produces only an app-authored,
// typed gap (what was searched, what failed — drawn from the real trace). The earlier 'label'
// branch ("answer from general knowledge, labelled from the model") is RETIRED by product
// decision: UNSOURCED_ANSWERS has one value, kept as a named constant so the policy is
// greppable in one place. A live-data ask is a gap likewise (a model's weather is a guess).
