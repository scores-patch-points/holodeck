// fold-chat-impression.js — keep the difference that makes a difference, not the page.
//
// A read page is up to 24,000 characters; the model used to be shown the first
// 4,000. For an encyclopedia article that is the introduction, and the sentence
// that answers the ask (how long per side, what year, which dose) is on page
// nine. And holding every page whole is not the point of reading it: what has
// to outlive the read is an IMPRESSION — the few sentences that make a
// difference to the ask — with the page's SHADOW behind it.
//
// This is the holograph's own keyless memory (THE-HOLOGRAPH §3, relative.js),
// not a string scorer:
//
//   SHADOW   every sentence of the page is admitted to a Field as a shadow node:
//            the state its words light (bits) and its ADDRESS in the page — no
//            words. The ask recalls against that field (`Field.recall`): start
//            from the cue's state and let activation settle.
//   NULL BAND  what counts as a recall is not chosen. `nullBand` measures what
//            a cue of this length pulls out of THIS field by chance, from the
//            field's own vocabulary; a sentence below the weakest chance top
//            (`lo`) is noise, and one between lo and hi must earn its place by
//            REACH. A word every sentence carries lifts every sentence the same
//            and so lifts none above the band — that is "a difference that makes
//            no difference", measured, not listed.
//   REACH    the cut (`dmdWindow`'s question, "does showing one more sentence
//            change what the ask reaches?"): a recalled sentence is kept only if
//            it carries a cue word that tells sentences apart, or a figure, not
//            already carried by what is kept. A restatement reaches nothing new.
//   ECHO     the coarse tier (512 bits, 64 bytes): "something like this was said
//            here", never read back. It rides the record beside the shadow.
//
// The impression is the kept sentences, re-expanded from the page by their
// ADDRESS (byte ranges) — the holograph's re-expansion through the record. The
// shadow keeps those addresses, the page's length and a fingerprint, so what was
// kept stays checkable after the page itself is dropped.
//
// Nothing here keys on capitals or on a language's word list: word boundaries
// come from the script (`segments`, Intl.Segmenter), and what is common comes
// from the page itself. Deterministic: the null band is drawn from a PRNG seeded
// by the page and the ask, so the same page and ask give the same impression.
