// fold-chat-mind.js — the chat's perceiving step, pure (no DOM, no IO, no model).
//
// The chat is a surface; it must not retrieve by string search on the raw words
// of the last message. khora/native/docs/THE-HOLOGRAPH.md §6: "A question
// activates referents — its own, or the last answer's when it names none." This
// module is that step for a chat turn:
//
//   admitReferents   what a finished turn established (its question, its answer,
//                    and the titles of the sources that grounded it) becomes the
//                    chat's referent record. A source TITLE is the strongest
//                    authority for an entity's name — it is in the language and
//                    script of the source, never inferred from capitalisation.
//   resolveQuestion  a question that names none of its own referents is read
//                    through the record's most active ones, and says so: the
//                    result carries what was carried and why, so the surface can
//                    show "Read 'him' as …" and the person can correct it.
//
// OMNILINGUAL BY CONSTRUCTION (THE-HOLOGRAPH.md §"Reading is omnilingual…"):
// nothing here keys on capital letters unless the SCRIPT says case is
// significant. `capitalisationIsSignificant` is a fact about a script, so Han,
// Kana, Hangul, Arabic, Hebrew, Devanagari and Thai never read as 'no beings'.
// Word boundaries come from Intl.Segmenter, not from spaces.
//
// NOTHING IS A SETTING WITHOUT A GIVER (Constitution II.11): the few numbers
// below are named declarations in DECLARED, each with the reason it stands, not
// measured constants. Language priors (pronoun forms, titles) are INJECTED
// (`hints`), never hand-typed here; they come from the ethos priors.
