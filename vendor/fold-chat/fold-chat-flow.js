// fold-chat-flow.js — Terry Gross: the archon of conversations, keeper of the flow rules. Pure: no DOM, no IO, no model.
//
// Terry Gross (the khora's the-fold/earned-cast.js, vendored by closure) reads a conversation's FLOW: what speech act the turn
// is — a question, an assertion, a push-back, a frame-ask, a map-ask — and what the reply should hear about it. Her facts are
// OBJECT-LEVEL and COVERT: never her name, never a role line, never an apparatus noun reaches the mouth (`bannedHits`), and
// the mouth is never told a persona is speaking.
//
// This chat already follows the thread (fold-chat-thread.js `turnPlan`: "what?", "shorter", "i want a chewier one"). Terry adds
// what that module does not read, and builds on it rather than beside it:
//
//   planTurn      turnPlan, plus the moves Terry reads that are about the CONVERSATION and not about the web: a short
//                 push-back ("are you sure?", "prove it", "wait, what"), a short frame-ask ("so what does it all mean") or
//                 map-ask ("how do these fit together"). With an earlier answer to follow they are replies about THAT answer
//                 (no search, the model grounded in the thread); with nothing earlier they are the cold gap — no search,
//                 no model, an app-authored note. Anything that names a topic of its own stays a standalone ask: "actually,
//                 what is the tallest mountain" is searched as asked. (The person's words are never rewritten.)
//   cuesFor       the facts the reply hears: Terry's own, for the act of this turn and the felt shape of the recent answers
//                 (fold-chat-pathos.js), each read by Gary's rules and stripped of any prohibition clause (Gary: a fact the
//                 model reasons from, never an instruction about what not to say), then by the covert ban.
//   FLOW_ENFORCEMENT  Terry's flow rules, each with the code of THIS app that enforces it — or null, so an unwired rule stays
//                 visible (Constitution VI.3: unwired-is-failing only works if unwired is VISIBLE).
//
// DECLARED, NOT MEASURED (II.11): the move limits below. Giver: the same short-ask limit fold-chat-thread.js declares from the
// ethos study (a long ask names enough on its own), and the author's reading that a push-back or a frame-ask carries at most
// its own two content words. fold-chat-flow.test.mjs pins the false-positive side (a standalone ask is never turned into a
// move) on the eval's own asks. Terry's detectors are English: a language she does not recognise is simply never treated as a
// move (a typed gap, not a guess) — never a wrong move, and never case logic (nothing here reads capitals or a script).
