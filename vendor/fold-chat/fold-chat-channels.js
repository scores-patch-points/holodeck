// fold-chat-channels.js — SEPARATE CHANNELS for one assistant message.
//
// A message is written by more than one author, and the record keeps them
// apart (Constitution II.9 the mouth test: a model authored THIS and only this;
// III.3 the absent test: a gap is DRAWN, as a typed mark, not said as prose):
//
//   message.content          ONLY what the model wrote. Nothing system-authored
//                            is ever appended. History, the conversation fold,
//                            chat naming, fork / continue / edit read this.
//   record.void              the gap, STRUCTURED (see voidReport) — drawn as its
//                            own element, never a sentence the assistant said.
//   message.notices          system notes about the turn (an identity claim the
//                            fold withdrew, a model refusal it replaced, an agent
//                            that produced no code) — each its own element.
//   record.process           what the fold DID (classify → search → read …).
//
// This module is pure and node-testable: no DOM, no IO. It holds the void
// report, its one-line text (for the process panel ONLY), the migration of
// sessions stored before the channels were split, and `modelHistory` — the one
// function that decides what of the transcript may ride back to the model.
