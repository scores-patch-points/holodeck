// The Fold finds a recipe; it does not rewrite it. When a read page declares a recipe, the card the person
// sees is that page's OWN ingredients and steps, verbatim, under the creator's name, with the way back to
// the page (khora/verbatim-snip: the source's bytes stay the source's). The model never retypes it: it may
// introduce which sources were found and how they differ, and that is all (Constitution II.9 — the mouth may
// phrase, never originate; and the creator's work is cited, not laundered into the model's voice).
//
// TIPPING is a feature in development. The Fold pays and sends nothing. The "Tip the creator" control finds how the
// creator's own site says to reach them and opens the person's own email app with a draft (fold-chat-tip.js); the
// person reads and sends it themselves. The card says so plainly.
