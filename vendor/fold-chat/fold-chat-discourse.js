// fold-chat-discourse.js — the discourse classifier (the holodeck's lesson).
//
// A turn is one of four kinds, and the kind decides the whole pipeline. This
// is the pure, testable core; the surface reads it to choose prompt, search,
// and whether a grounding disclosure even applies.
//
//   smalltalk — a greeting or thank-you. Plain chat: no web search, no
//               grounding. A greeting gets a greeting.
//   generate  — "write / compose / an essay on / draft / build …": the person
//               wants an ARTIFACT. No web search front-loads it and no
//               clarifying quiz — the fold writes it now. (The loud failure
//               this fixes: "write about the extinction of dolphins" became
//               "please tell me what topics to cover".)
//   research  — a question of fact ("who is / when / what is / how many", a
//               bare lookup, or anything with a "?"): search, read, answer
//               from what was read.
//   chat      — everything else: plain conversation.
//   compute / transform / code / compose / advice — the EVERYDAY kinds added
//               2026-10-05 (fold-chat-kinds.js has the shapes and the reasons):
//               arithmetic and unit asks the fold computes itself, the person's
//               own text to translate/summarise, programming how-tos, personal
//               correspondence — none of these searches the web or draws a void —
//               and open how-to advice (searched, but no void unless it commits
//               to figures nothing read says).
//
// Pure: no DOM, no IO. Node-testable.
