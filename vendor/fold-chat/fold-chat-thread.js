// fold-chat-thread.js — the conversation is a source: follow the thread before any search. Pure: no DOM, no IO, no model.
//
// Measured 2026-10-05 in the live app:
//   • after a cookie-recipe turn the person said "i want a chewier one". The app searched that literal phrase, got a
//     bot-challenge page and two unrelated snippets (Chinese takeout), and showed them as the answer. The referent was lost.
//   • the person said "what?" after an answer. The app searched the web for "what?", got a 502 and drew a gap.
//
// What this module decides, from the ask and the turns BEFORE it (never from the web):
//   meta        "what?", "why?", "explain that", "shorter", "I don't get it" — a request about the PREVIOUS ANSWER. No search
//               is made. With an earlier answer to follow, the model may reply, grounded ONLY in that earlier turn, labelled
//               "answered from this conversation" and citing the turn. With NO earlier answer (a cold "what?") nothing is
//               written: an app-authored note, no model call.
//   carried     the language's pronoun triggers (fold-chat-hints.js, from the ethos priors) + the referent record
//               (fold-chat-mind.js resolveQuestion): "what happened to him?" is searched about the last answer's referent.
//   elliptical  a short ask with no name of its own that leans on the last topic ("i want a chewier one"): the search query
//               carries the earlier topic ("chewier chocolate chip cookie recipe"). The person's words are never rewritten;
//               the feed shows what was searched.
//   standalone  everything else: searched as asked.
//
// DECLARED, NOT MEASURED (Constitution II.11): the word limit below (a short ask is ≤ 8 words — the ethos study measured
// 85% wrong inheritance on UNGATED short asks, so a cue is still required) and the cue lists, each with its giver: the
// author's reading of how English follow-ups are phrased; a language without these cues is simply never treated as
// elliptical or meta (a typed gap, not a guess).
